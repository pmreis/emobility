A repository containing a wide range of information related with electric mobility in Europe, with a focus on Portugal.

Here you can find references to legal frameworks, existing APIs, documentation and data.

The goal is to track the evolution of sustainable mobility milestones on each European country and also find inconsistencies and blockers.

## The European Green Deal

The European Green Deal is a set of policy initiatives launched by the European Union (EU) aimed at making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level where they are balanced by removal or offsetting, effectively eliminating the net contribution to global warming.

**Key Goals**:
1. **Climate Neutrality by 2050**: The primary goal is to reduce EU's greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (from 1990 levels) and to achieve full climate neutrality by 2050.

2. **Economic Growth Decoupled from Resource Use**: The deal promotes economic growth that doesn't rely on the unsustainable consumption of natural resources, transitioning towards a circular economy where waste is minimized and resources are reused.

3. **No Person and No Place Left Behind**: The Green Deal includes a "Just Transition Mechanism" to support regions and workers who might be adversely affected by the transition to a green economy, ensuring fairness and equity in the shift towards sustainability.

**Priorities**:
1. Clean Energy
    - Supplying clean, affordable and secure energy
2. Circular Economy
    - Mobilising industry for a clean and circular economy
3. Efficient Renovations
    - Building and renovating in an energy andd resource efficient way
4. Sustainable Mobility
    - Accelerating the shift to sustainable and smart mobility
5. Sustainable Food
    - From 'Farm to Fork': designing a fair, healthy and environmentally-friendly food system
6. Preserving Biodiversity
    - Preserving and restoring ecosystems and biodiversity
7. Climate Action
    - Increasing the EU's climate ambition for 2030 and 2050
8. Zero Pollution
    - A zero pollution ambition for a toxic-free environment

## The Fit for 55 package

The **Fit for 55 package** is a central part of the **European Green Deal**. It consists of a set of legislative proposals designed to ensure that the European Union (EU) meets its target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels), which is a crucial milestone towards achieving the broader goal of climate neutrality by 2050 as outlined in the European Green Deal.

## AFIR - Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation

The **Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR)** is a key legislative proposal within the **Fit for 55 package**, which itself is part of the broader **European Green Deal**. AFIR aims to establish a comprehensive and cohesive infrastructure across the European Union for alternative fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen, and biofuels, to support the decarbonization of the transport sector.

## Portuguese legal framework for electric mobility

In August 2025, Portugal overhauled the RJME via Decree-Law 93/2025 to align with the EU’s Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR, applicable since 13 April 2024). The new regime mandates ad-hoc charging (no prior contract), broad electronic payment options (e.g., bank card/QR), open roaming, smart and bidirectional charging, adds maritime charging, eliminates the CEME figure and the previous centralized network management, and sets a transition period until 31 December 2026 to meet AFIR’s data/transparency rules and EU coverage/power goals.

* Chart data source = IMT / Mobi.e

#### Notes on Mobi.e :
During the transition period (until December 31, 2026), Mobi.e will provide data to the official National Access Point (IMT).

Mobi.e's reach and responsibilities extend beyond a NAP, namely it is responsible for activation and finantial flows of the charging infrastructure. Mobi.e is a monopoly established by law, as recognized by the national energy regulator ERSE and also a mandatory roaming platform.

#### Possible barriers for eMobility in Portugal

Portugal set its legal framework for electric mobility in 2010 with Decree-Law 39/2010, creating the RJME and the MOBI.E-based, centrally managed model with defined market roles and incentives, which structured how charging operators and service providers interacted and how a public pilot network would be deployed. Over the years the RJME was amended but kept that centralized architecture as the backbone of the system.

Although initially praised, the Portuguese model later became a source of frustration for EV users, revealed several areas needing urgent improvement, and above all failed to comply with AFIR. This lead some entities to report on the issues or barriers of the Portuguese model, which can still be found below.

#### Autoridade da Concorrência (AdC)

The Portuguese Competition Authority – Autoridade da Concorrência (AdC) carried out an analysis of the competition conditions in the electric vehicle recharging sector, which resulted in the identification of barriers that could jeopardise the development and expansion of an electric vehicle recharging network with adequate, efficient, and competitive coverage.

#### Public consultation on the Study into Competition and Electric Vehicle Recharging in Portugal

This was the AdC's most participated public consultation, which illustrates the high level of interest in this sector. Alongside the opinion of the sector's regulator - ERSE - the AdC received 183 contributions from public entities, individual consumers, consumer associations, operators and associations of companies in the electric mobility sector, entities in the electricity sector and entities from other sectors.

#### AVERE

AVERE has taken note of the preliminary report of the Estudo concorrência e mobilidade elétrica em Portugal and wish to express our agreement with the intention of the recommendations made to the Portuguese government to make fundamental changes to the Portuguese recharging network, to improve the current system in benefit of BEV users.
